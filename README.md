# Transduction on Directed Graphs via Absorbing Random Walks

This is a collection of MATLAB codes that implement our algorithm and comparison methods in the above paper.


## About
In this collection, we include implementations of 11 algorithms, among which we implemented the following algorithms:
+ Our own algorithm proposed in [1],
+ Digraph variant of the Commute Time Kernel classifier (CTKd) [2],
+ Regularized Commute Time Kernel classifier (RCTKd) [2],
+ Symmetrized Graph Laplacian (SGL) [3],
+ Zero-mode Free Laplacian (ZFL) [4],
+ Biased Discriminative random Walks (bDWALK) [5].

For the following methods:
+ Network-only Bayes Classifier (NBC) [6],
+ Network-only Link Based classifier (NLB) [7],
+ Class Distribution Relational Neighbor classifier (CDRN) [8],
+ Weighted Vote Relational Neighbor classifier (WVRN) [8],

we adopted the implementation by NetKit [8] in Java. Finally, the implementation of 
+ Sum Over Path covariance kernel (SOP) [9]

is borrowed from the authors of [9].

## Folders
+ `codes/`: contains all the source codes implementing the above 11 algorithms
+ `data/`: default path to local files storing datasets
+ `results/`: stores the computed solutions and total running time
+ `test/`: contains basic test codes. There are several subfolders, each of which corresponds to an individual dataset.


## Example
Take CiteseerX dataset for example. Proceed to folder `test/CiteseerX/`, and execute `run_citeseerX.m` in the command window of MATLAB.
